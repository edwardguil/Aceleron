A Simple Parallelized Neural Network Framework in C++ and Python! 
## Overview
This is a Neural Network framework that covers core mechanics of traditional neural network techniques (FCN's) and it's approach from a high performance computing perspective. 

## Features:
- Layers:
  - Dense
- Activations:
  - SoftMax
  - ReLU
- Losses/Costs:
  - Categorical Cross Entropy
  - Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- Optimizers:
  - SGD
