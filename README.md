# edNet
A simple Neural Network Framework! 
## Overview
This is a basic Neural Network framework meant to teach myself how popular NN libraries work. Implementations are in Python and C++. 

## Features:
- Layers:
  - Dense
- Activations:
  - SoftMax
  - ReLU
- Losses/Costs:
  - Categorical Cross Entropy
  - Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- Optimizers:
  - SGD

## Installation C++
1) Clone repo
2) Cd to C++ dir
3) Run "make" in terminal
4) Run "./driver2 1000" for demonstration


## Installation Python
1) Clone repo
2) Install dependacies (numpy)
3) Run driver2.py for demonstration
